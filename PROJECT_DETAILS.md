# GitCanvas Contributor Guide for ACM Sourcery

This document is tailored for contributors participating in the open source event Sourcery by ACM IGDTUW.

## 1. Project Overview

### Description

- Backend/API: FastAPI
- Language: Python 3
- Data Source: GitHub REST APIs
- AI Integration: OpenAI and Google Gemini support for roast mode
- Image/Output: SVG-based generators with optional raster export

### Current Features
- 15+ visual themes for contribution graph rendering
- Multiple README-ready cards: stats, streak, repo, language, trophy, social, and activity
- AI roast widget with multiple tones
- Export-friendly SVG output for profile personalization
- FastAPI endpoints for card generation

### Target Users
- GitHub users who want personalized profile visuals
- Open source contributors building profile tools
- Students and developers exploring creative data visualization

## 2. Architecture and Key Modules

### Module Overview

| Module | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Streamlit App | app.py | Main interactive UI for users |
| Roast Widget App | roast_widget_streamlit.py | Dedicated AI roast interface |
| API Service | api/main.py | FastAPI entrypoint with route handlers |
| AI Services | ai/ | Roast service and model integration logic |
| Card Generators | generators/ | SVG builders for all card variants |
| Themes | themes/ and themes/json/ | Theme definitions and palettes |
| Utilities | utils/ | GitHub API wrappers, caching, validation, logging, rate limiting |

### High-Level Flow
1. User provides a GitHub username and card/theme preferences.
2. Utility layer fetches GitHub data with validation and caching.
3. Generator layer builds themed SVG output.
4. Streamlit and API layers expose downloadable and embeddable results.

## 3. Feature Ideas for Sourcery Contributors

### Feature 1: Theme Preview Grid in Streamlit
Problem it solves: Contributors currently switch themes one-by-one to compare outputs.

- Difficulty: Beginner
- Estimated effort: 4-6 hours
- Suggested files:
  - app.py
  - themes/styles.py

### Feature 2: Theme Metadata and Search
Problem it solves: Finding themes by vibe (retro, sci-fi, sports) is manual.

- Difficulty: Beginner to Intermediate
- Estimated effort: 6-8 hours
- Suggested files:
  - themes/__init__.py
  - themes/json/*.json
  - app.py

### Feature 3: Add Compact Card Layout Variant
Problem it solves: Existing cards can feel large for minimal README layouts.

- Difficulty: Intermediate
- Estimated effort: 8-12 hours
- Suggested files:
  - generators/svg_base.py
  - generators/stats_card.py
  - generators/repo_card.py

### Feature 4: Better GitHub API Error Messaging
Problem it solves: Users need clearer next steps when rate-limited or username is invalid.

- Difficulty: Intermediate
- Estimated effort: 6-10 hours
- Suggested files:
  - utils/github_api.py
  - utils/validators.py
  - utils/api_validators.py
  - app.py

### Feature 5: Add Basic Tests for Generators
Problem it solves: Generator changes are hard to validate quickly and safely.

- Difficulty: Intermediate
- Estimated effort: 8-14 hours
- Suggested files:
  - tests/ (new folder)
  - generators/*.py

## 4. Implementation Pipeline (Recommended)

Follow this checklist for any feature PR during Sourcery.

1. Understand scope
- Pick one issue and confirm expected output in the PR description.

2. Set up locally
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
- Run streamlit run app.py.
- Optionally run the API using uvicorn.

3. Implement small and focused changes
- Keep PRs single-purpose.
- Reuse utility modules where possible.

4. Validate with real usernames
- Test at least 2-3 public GitHub profiles.
- Check behavior when data is missing or sparse.

5. Verify outputs
- Ensure generated SVG renders correctly.
- Check readability in light/dark GitHub themes where relevant.

6. Submit polished PR
- Add before/after screenshots for visual changes.
- Mention files touched and testing done.

## 5. Good First Issues

### Issue 1: Improve Copy Text in UI
- Update wording for clarity and grammar.
- Files: app.py, roast_widget_streamlit.py

### Issue 2: Add Empty-State Message for Missing Repos
- Show user-friendly text when repo list is empty.
- Files: generators/repo_card.py, utils/github_utils.py

### Issue 3: Add One New Theme JSON
- Add one original theme and register it.
- Files: themes/json/*.json, themes/__init__.py

### Issue 4: Expose Rate Limit Info in UI
- Display remaining calls and reset time.
- Files: utils/rate_limiter.py, app.py

### Issue 5: Document One API Endpoint Better
- Improve example request/response in docs.
- Files: README.md or PROJECT_DETAILS.md

## 6. Contributor Notes

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### Local Setup
```bash
### Fork-First Workflow (Required for External Contributors)
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally, not the upstream repository.
3. Create a feature branch, push to your fork, then open a PR from your fork to upstream.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GitCanvas.git
cd GitCanvas
git remote add upstream https://github.com/devanshi14malhotra/GitCanvas.git
git checkout -b feature/your-change
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Optional Environment Variables
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Raises API limit significantly for GitHub requests
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Enables OpenAI-based roast generation
- GEMINI_API_KEY: Enables Gemini-based roast generation

### Contribution Rules
- Use real GitHub data only.
- Keep functions modular and readable.
- Do not break existing themes or card contracts.
- Add concise docs for any new user-facing behavior.

### PR Checklist
- Repository was forked and branch was pushed to your fork.
- Pull request target is `devanshi14malhotra/GitCanvas`.
- Code runs locally.
- Visual output verified for the changed card/theme.
- README or inline docs updated if behavior changed.
- PR includes clear summary and screenshots when UI is affected.
